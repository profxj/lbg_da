Hey John,

Thanks again for helping me out with this! Everything you need to
run the SED fitting on our bootstrap iterations should be in
this directory! 

All you need to do, is run the sedfitter.pro routine for both
redshfit bins: ("lowz" and "hiz"). The sedfitter routine
is a slightly modified version of the cont_fit.pro routine that 
you shared with me.

It is well commented but unetested! As you know, I don't have access to
IDL right now and I wrote it out in a text editor. I am still learning,
but it should work!
 
Though I have been careful, I would appreciate it if you read through
the routine thoroughly to see if I have made mistakes. The comments 
should walk you through what it is that I am trying to do. Let me know
if you have any questions!!!

Cheers,
JSM

p.s.

when in doubt, I reverted to like a pythonish psuedo-code.
Sorry if it doesn't work out the box!
